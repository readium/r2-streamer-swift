Readium Streamer aims at simplifying the usage of numeric publication by parsing and serving them.
It takes the publication as input, and generates an accessible [WebPubManifest](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest)/object as output.

[Changes and releases are documented in the Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

# Get started


## Adding the library to your iOS project

> _Note:_ requires Swift 4.2 (and Xcode 10.1).

### Carthage

[Carthage][] is a simple, decentralized dependency manager for Cocoa. To
install R2Streamer with Carthage:

 1. Make sure Carthage is [installed][Carthage Installation].

 2. Update your Cartfile to include the following:

    ```ruby
    github "readium/r2-streamer-swift" "develop"
    ```
    
 3. Run:
    * [`mkdir -p Carthage/Build/iOS`](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/3122#issuecomment-784865551)
    * `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`

 4. [Add the appropriate framework][Carthage Usage].

[Carthage Installation]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage
[Carthage Usage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application


##### Import

In your Swift files :

```Swift
// Swift source file

import R2Streamer
```

# Parsing publications

##### EPUB
`let parser = EpubParser()`

##### CBZ
`let parser = CbzParser()`

##### Parsing
```Swift
...
var parseResult: PubBox

do {
    parseResult = try parser.parse(fileAtPath: path)
} catch {
    // `{Type}ParserError` exception handling
}

/// Get `Publication` from the `parseResult`
let publication = parseResult.publication

/// Access `Publication` content
let metadata = publication.metadata
let tableOfContent = publication.tableOfContent
let spineItems = publication.spine
//...
```

You can now access your publications content programmatically. The `Publication` object is described in details [here](https://readium.github.io/r2-streamer-swift/Classes/Publication.html).

# Built in HTTP server

##### Initializing the server
R2Streamer provides a local HTTP server called `PublicationSever`, this allow access to the resources of the `Publication`.

```Swift
/// Instantiation of the HTTP server
guard let publicationServer = PublicationServer() else {
    // Error
}
```

##### Adding publications to the server
You can add your parsed publication to the server at the desired endpoints. (The endpoint parameter is optional, an `UUID` will be generated if let empty as below)

```Swift
/// Adding a publication to the server (Using the above section variables)
do {
    try publicationServer.add(publication, with: container/* ,"customEndpoint" */)
} catch {
    // `PublicationServerError` exception handling
}
```

When a Publication is added to the server, a new 'self' `Link` is added to the `Publication`'s `links` property.
The `Publication` now know how to locate its resources over HTTP. See below for an example.

##### Accessing a `Link` resource from the server
The `Publication` is described using `Link`s. Each link describe a resource from the publication in a Publication-relative way.

```Swift
/// Accessing any `Link` resource over HTTP
let cover = publication.coverLink // Or `spineItems[x]`...

let coverUri = publication.uri(forLink: cover)
print(coverUri) // "http://{serverip}:{serverport}/{endpoint}/{`cover.href`}"
```

##### Removing a publication from the server
Using the `Publication` itself:

`publicationServer.remove(publication)`

Or it's endpoint:

`publicationServer.remove(at: "endpoint")`

# WebPub Manifest

For further informations see [readium/webpub-manifest](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest).

##### Pretty
`publication.manifest()`

##### Canonical
`publication.manifestCanonical()`
